# Fabricated Files & Folders

Practice for emulating core functionality of a Linux-style shell with respect to managing a file system. User can interact with a set of commands via a command-line familiar to users of Linux. Files and folders are not actually created in any form, this program focuses on the management aspect only. The read/write/execute permissions for Owner, Group, and Public are arbitrarily assigned.
Supported commands:
```
ls
ls -l
cd
pwd
mkdir
rmdir
rm
chmod
touch
exit/quit
```
touch 'creates' a file or updates the timestamp
